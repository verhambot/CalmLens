<h1>Anxiety: What Is Anxiety and its Causes, Symptoms & Types</h1>

<p>Anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses and is observed in many forms and intensities. Understanding its nature, causes and symptoms can help you gain an upper hand in your battle with anxiety.</p>

<p>Anxiety disorders are the most commonly occurring mental illness. In fact, over 3.8 crore Indians are struggling with anxiety disorders. The American Psychological Association (APA) defines anxiety as "an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure".</p>

<p>Though a little anxiety is a perfectly natural response to stimuli that we might deem "unsafe", disproportionately high or persistent levels of anxiety can be highly distressing. If this feeling of anxiety reaches extreme levels for a period over six months and interferes with your day-to-day functioning or decreases the quality of your life, you are likely to be suffering from an anxiety disorder.</p>

<h2>What causes Anxiety?</h2>
<p>The causes of anxiety vary from person to person and may depend on age, occupation, family history and other social and environmental factors. For instance, the greater fear of not succeeding in the highly competitive modern markets is strongly correlated with Millennials. For older generations, the lack of social support or meaningful friendships in old age can be a cause of distress and hence are more prone to alarming levels of anxiety.</p>

<p>However, there are still many general causes of anxiety:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Environmental Factors: Stress at work, unstable relationships, or family issues</li>
    <li>Genetic Factors: Individuals with a family history of anxiety disorders are more prone to developing anxiety disorders</li>
    <li>Medical Factors: Anxiety can manifest as a symptom of a medical condition, or as a side-effect of certain medications</li>
    <li>Biological Factors: Anxiety can also be caused due to a misalignment of hormones in the brain</li>
</ul>
